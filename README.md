Raw data for "The effect of a color tattoo on the skin redox regulatory network: an N-of-1 study"

A dataset with raw values from the "The effect of a color tattoo on the local skin redox regulatory network: an N-of-1 study" containing raw values of the tattoo and the control sample for 
1) sample mediated-H2O2 dissociation rate measured by carbonato-cobaltate (III) formation in multiple time points
2) 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)-based determination of free thiol content in low molecular weight and protein precipitate fractions
3) Nitrocellulose redox permanganometry (NRP)-determined reductive capacity 
4) Oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)-determined reductive capacity
5) 1,2,3-Trihydroxybenzene autooxidation-determined superoxide dismutase activity
6) Thiobarbituric reactive substances assay-derived lipid peroxidation end product concentration
